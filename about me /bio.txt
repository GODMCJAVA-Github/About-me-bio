Greetings, I go by the moniker GODMCJAVA, but don't be misled by the name â€“ it's not just about God, Minecraft, or Java. You can call me GJ or GMJ. I'm an avid gamer, diving into a multitude of games, and I'm open to almost any gaming experience.

In the realm of Discord, I'm no stranger. Unfortunately, my previous account, "GODMCJAVA," fell victim to hacking. As a result, I've now reemerged with a fresh start on my new account, aptly named "GODMCJAVA_." Let the gaming adventures continue!
